### 

I want to get back into relearning PHP, HTML and CSS coding.  I am finding my feet back into the IT field, after being out of it for 8 years so I am quite rusty in my IT skills. I am looking to work in DevOps and software testing in due time when I have reacquired my coding skills back to where it used to be.  I'm also throwing some Python in the coding works too.

I am currently studying CompTIA Network+ and aim to write my exam soon, hopefully to pass this time.  Then I will be going onto CompTIA Security+ and obtain my certification hopefully before August this year.
